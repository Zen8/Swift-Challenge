# Swift-Challenge
Build a Smartwatch Challenge in Mimo

You're part of the project to build the new Activity feature for a smartwatch. Unfortuntely, the data you are receiving
isn't formatted for users to understand what they are doing. 

You'll need to take the activityData constant that comes from the smartwatch and parse it for specific data.

Declare a numberOfSteps integer to track the number of times "1" appears in activityData and a numberOfHeartBeats variable to track the number of times "2" appears in activityData.
